# Bank Loan Dashboard using Power BI

## Overview
This project demonstrates a **Bank Loan Dashboard** created using **Power BI** to visualize and analyze loan approval data. The dashboard provides insights into various loan application attributes and helps bank decision-makers understand patterns, trends, and make data-driven decisions regarding loan approvals.

The dashboard provides interactive visualizations, including:
- Loan approval statistics
- Applicant demographics
- Loan amount distributions
- Approval trends over time
- Key performance indicators (KPIs) for loan management

## Features
- **Interactive Visuals**: Explore the loan data interactively with filters and slicers for various categories (e.g., income, loan amount, approval status).
- **Loan Analysis**: Analyze loan approval rates, applicant income, loan amount distributions, and approval trends over time.
- **KPIs**: View key performance metrics such as approval percentage, average loan amount, and approval vs. rejection trends.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a clean layout for easy navigation and data exploration.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI** (Dashboard design and data visualization)
- **Excel/CSV** (Dataset for loan applications)
- **Power BI Desktop** (For creating the dashboard)

## Dataset
The dataset used for the dashboard contains details about loan applications, including:
- Applicant’s income
- Credit score
- Loan amount
- Employment status
- Marital status
- Previous loan history
- Loan approval status (approved/rejected)
